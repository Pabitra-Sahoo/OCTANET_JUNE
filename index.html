            <span>God Of The New World</span>
            <p>The Six Paths of Pain was a jutsu used by Nagato Uzumaki with the help of Rinnegan. It allowed Nagato to
                control six different bodies as if they were his own. Each of these bodies was a reanimated corpse,
                which made use of Nagato's chakra.
                The Six Paths, as the series revealed, are called as follows: Deva Path, Asura Path, Human Path, Animal
                Path, Preta Path, and Naraka Path.All of them have different powers.With these power Pain destroyed the
                konha village with a single blow.</p>
